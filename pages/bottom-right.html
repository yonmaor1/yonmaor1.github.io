    <h2>flatbed 3d scanning</h2>
    <h3>i'm currently working on building a process to use a flatbed scanner to generate 3d scans of small objects</h3>
    <h3>this is a my capstone project for my electrical and computer engineering degree, and is a continuation of work i started in Golan Levin's Experimental Capture Studio in fall 2024</h3>

    <h2>p5-flipdots</h2>
    <h3>i built a p5.js library to interface with a flipdot display via a node.js server</h3>
    <h3>the library implements several methods to cast to the display, and was used by Pf. Golan Levin at CMU to teach shader graphics in his creative coding class</h3>
    <h3>i also built a similar library for getting inputs and outputs from littlebits, and was similarily used to teach physical computing</h3>

    <h2>umap-grid</h2>
    <h3>i built a python library that uses uniform manifold approximation and projection (umap) and rectangular interpolation to sort images into a grid by similarity</h3>

    <h2>biohybrid and organic robotics group (borg)</h2>
    <h3>as a research assistant at cmu's borg lab, I build a multi-used flask UI for performing user trials of pick and place operations on soft robots</h3>

    <h2>cmcp</h2>
    <h3>i am a founder and board member of the carnegie mellon college progressives</h3>
    <h3>on top of my regular responcibilities as a board member, i also am a graphic designer and editor of the club's publication, the Turner Hall Review</h3>
    <h3>i also designed and built the club's website</h3>
